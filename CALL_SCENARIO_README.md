# CallScenario Functionality

## Overview

This document describes the `CallScenario` functionality that has been added to Reqnroll. This feature allows you to call scenarios from other features by name, enabling better test organization and reusability.

## API

### ITestRunner.CallScenarioAsync

```csharp
Task CallScenarioAsync(string featureName, string scenarioName);
```

This method is available on the `ITestRunner` interface and can be used within step definitions to call scenarios from other features.

## Usage Example

### Helper Feature (HelperFeature.feature)

```gherkin
Feature: Helper Feature
    Common scenarios that can be reused across multiple features

Scenario: Setup Test Data
    Given I have configured the test database
    When I create the necessary test data
    Then the test data should be available

Scenario: Cleanup Test Data
    Given test data exists
    When I clean up the test data
    Then the test data should be removed
```

### Main Feature (MainFeature.feature)

```gherkin
Feature: Main Feature
    Main test scenarios that use helper scenarios

Scenario: Complete User Journey
    Given I call scenario "Setup Test Data" from feature "Helper Feature"
    When I perform the main user actions
    Then the expected results should be achieved
    And I call scenario "Cleanup Test Data" from feature "Helper Feature"
```

### Built-in Step Definitions

Reqnroll now includes built-in step definitions for the CallScenario functionality. No additional step definition code is required - you can use the step directly in your feature files:

- `Given I call scenario "scenario name" from feature "feature name"`  
- `When I call scenario "scenario name" from feature "feature name"`
- `Then I call scenario "scenario name" from feature "feature name"`

The step definitions are automatically available in all Reqnroll projects.

## Current Status

The API is currently implemented with the following status:

- ✅ **API Available**: The `CallScenarioAsync` method is available on `ITestRunner`
- ✅ **Parameter Validation**: Proper validation for feature name and scenario name
- ✅ **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage for the API
- ✅ **Integration Ready**: Infrastructure in place for full implementation
- ⚠️ **Not Fully Implemented**: Currently throws `NotImplementedException` with details

## Implementation Details

### Current Implementation

The current implementation includes:

1. **Interface Definition**: `ITestRunner.CallScenarioAsync(string featureName, string scenarioName)`
2. **Parameter Validation**: Validates that both feature name and scenario name are provided
3. **Error Handling**: Throws appropriate exceptions for invalid parameters
4. **Infrastructure**: Basic scenario registry infrastructure for future use

### Future Implementation

The full implementation will include:

1. **Scenario Discovery**: Mechanism to find scenarios by feature and scenario name
2. **Scenario Execution**: Execute the found scenario within the current test context
3. **Context Management**: Proper handling of feature and scenario contexts
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for missing scenarios

## Error Handling

The API currently provides the following error handling:

- `ArgumentException`: Thrown when feature name or scenario name is null or empty
- `NotImplementedException`: Thrown when the method is called (current state)

## Testing

Unit tests are provided in `Tests/Reqnroll.RuntimeTests/CallScenarioTests.cs` that cover:

- Parameter validation
- Error scenarios
- API availability verification

## Benefits

Once fully implemented, this feature will provide:

1. **Test Reusability**: Share common scenarios across multiple features
2. **Better Organization**: Keep setup and cleanup scenarios in dedicated helper features
3. **Maintainability**: Centralize common test logic in reusable scenarios
4. **Flexibility**: Build complex test flows by combining smaller scenarios

## Next Steps

To complete the implementation:

1. Implement scenario discovery mechanism
2. Add scenario execution logic
3. Handle context management for nested scenario calls
4. Add integration tests
5. Update documentation with full examples
